# meet

## Description
Meet is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. Meet uses the Google calendar API to fetch upcoming events for users specified by city. This app uses serverless to authorize users to be able to access event data from the Google Calendar API. 

## User Stories
- As a user, I should be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city.

- As a user, I should be able to see and hide an events details so that I can see view additional information on events I might be interested in.

- As a user, I should be able to see the number of events so that I know how many things are taking place that I can choose from.

- As a user, I should be able to use the app offline so that I do not have to rely on internet access to find something to do.

- As a user, I should see an app shortcut on my home screen so that I can easily access the app.

- As a user, I should see a chart showing the number of events by city so I can compare which cityâ€™s might be worth visiting.
